This is a Morse Code training program that I wrote in the autumn of 2015, when I was interested in learning JAVA.
The program was written entirely in Notepad++, because the available notebook couldn't run an IDE.
If I were to change anything, I would mostly try to write much more verbose comments.

Some files do not have copyright header, because after I finished the program I decided
not to make all of the code public, therefore there was no need to add copyright header to every file.

As I have now changed my mind, here is the complete source of the project. All files
remain unchanged from the project completion.
